Some still eat dogs, as I have recorded from Lakeba, Vanua Balavu, and Gau Island. Killing was by strangulation. But the dog is sacred in quite a number of places, as with the clan Nanuku-ira of the DauLakeba tribe, who have a black dog as their founding spirit. A dog is the iconic animal of a fair number of tribes. Fiji Melanesians have no tradition of keeping dogs for eating but highlanders would eat almost any living thing they could catch and that includes feral dogs and cats, introduced by Europeans. Dogs are often kept to help them in hunting pigs. Fijians have almost never kept dogs (or cats) as close members of the family, as the British do. Caution: in Macuata, koli can refer to fish. Feral or domestic dogs in Fiji are sometimes subject to mange caused by the scabies mite, Sarcoptes scabiei, which can be treated with pyrethrin, or its synthetic equivalent, permethrin. Heartworm is also a problem for dogs. Idiom: Lesu na koli ki na nona lua. lit. The dog returns to his vomit. i.e. the criminal returns to his crime. Idiom: Sa moce na koli e matadravu. Lit. the dog sleep in the fireplace (where food is cooked). There is no food at home. Idiom: vesu koli extremely hungry. Idiom: koli ni koro lit. village dog, a person who always stays around in the village.",
