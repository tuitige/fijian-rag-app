koli n. dog. The term does not derive from English "collie". Polynesians raised dogs, fed them a
vegetable starch diet, and ate them. Some still eat dogs, as I have recorded from Lakeba, Vanua
Balavu, and Gau Island. Killing was by strangulation. But the dog is sacred in quite a number of
places, as with the clan Nanuku-ira of the DauLakeba tribe, who have a black dog as their founding
spirit. A dog is the iconic animal of a fair number of tribes. Fiji Melanesians have no tradition of
keeping dogs for eating but highlanders would eat almost any living thing they could catch and that
includes feral dogs and cats, introduced by Europeans. Dogs are often kept to help them in hunting
pigs. Fijians have almost never kept dogs (or cats) as close members of the family, as the British do.
Caution: in Macuata, koli can refer to fish. Feral or domestic dogs in Fiji are sometimes subject to
mange caused by the scabies mite, Sarcoptes scabiei, which can be treated with pyrethrin, or its
synthetic equivalent, permethrin. Heartworm is also a problem for dogs.
Idiom: Lesu na koli ki na nona lua. lit. The dog returns to his vomit. i.e. the
criminal returns to his crime.
Idiom: Sa moce na koli e matadravu. Lit. the dog sleep in the fireplace (where
food is cooked). There is no food at home.
Idiom: vesu koli extremely hungry.
Idiom: koli ni koro lit. village dog, a person who always stays around in the
village.

Koli archaic honorific warrior title, now a common name, sometimes also an abbrev. for Kolinio (Colin).

koliji (Eng.) college.

kolo n. a "Fijian sickness", not readily identified in western medicine, often involving a persistent
backache, or for women, a hardness in the abdomen, usually attributed to being chilled by being wet
and cold around water, fishing or washing clothes. May involve a headache. Lumbago (keke) may be
part of the problem.

kolo, kolova, kolotaka v. to hurl (kolotaka) a stick or club (ikolo the object thrown) with a sweeping,
almost horizontal motion, usually now to bring down (kolova) fruit from a tree, or to hit a fruit bat with
a short stick, for food. Previously certain types of war-club were thrown this way in combat.
