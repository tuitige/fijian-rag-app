🌍 Empowering Fijians through Language, Culture, and AI

🧠 What is the Fijian AI Project?

The Fijian AI Project is a public-benefit initiative that brings the power of Generative AI and language technologies to the Fijian people — and to anyone who wants to learn, preserve, or connect with Fijian culture.

At its core, this project aims to:

🗣️ Enable conversational and educational AI tools in the Fijian language

📚 Preserve and revitalize traditional stories, grammar, and vocabulary

🌍 Empower locals, students, and visitors with culturally respectful translation tools

🧠 Enrich global AI with underrepresented linguistic data

🔧 Tech Stack: GenAI + RAG + Fine-Tuning

Generative AI: Powered by Claude (Anthropic) via AWS Bedrock

RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation using OpenSearch vector embeddings

Embedding & Search: High-precision semantic search across verified Fijian-English datasets

AWS Infrastructure: Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, OpenSearch, S3

Frontend: Angular + Amplify, designed for mobile and low-bandwidth environments

❗ Why Fijian Matters in AI

Fijian is a low-resource language, meaning:

Very limited high-quality digital content

Minimal representation in large AI models

Few or no TTS or ASR tools

By creating structured, verified datasets and an open pipeline, the Fijian AI Project makes the language accessible to AI models — and to future generations.

🚀 Future Roadmap

🎤 Train a Fijian Text-to-Speech engine with native voices

🧑‍🏫 Launch a full language learning app with progress tracking

🧭 Enable voice AI assistants in Fijian for tourism, schools, and government

🗃️ Create open datasets for fine-tuning multilingual models
